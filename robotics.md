Vex robotics:

- code
- journal thorughly
- [x] Shift bar near back wheel down one.
- [x] create drop intake
- [x] shift another component by one
- [x] the 3 above will make it in spec
      jan issues:
      something on the front is like hitting something, - needs to be fixed
      placement of the intake is tilted
      the donuts arent getting in
- [ ] fix the intake grabber thing -- needs a bar extenstion
- [ ] the aim is ok 1/3 chance of getting in. (as in it dont go all the way down but it still gets in sorta)
- [ ] the front intake is ok somehow, will get stuck when not moving & trying to take something in.
- [ ] please check photos for the exact angles 
  notes:
  4-6psi is used per click.
